Our goal for this project was to look at how different political parties viewed fakes news. Our data set was from the PEW Research center and it contained question such as "How well do you think you can determine a fake news story". These type of questions are the PEW questions and are at the end of this page. First we looked at how the variables were distributed.  

## Political Affiliations of Population

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width =1536, out.height=800}
party   <- ggplot(pewdata,aes(x=party, fill = ideo, group = ideo)) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge') +
  geom_text(stat = 'count', position=position_dodge(width = 1),
            aes(y = ..count..,  label = ..count.., vjust = 0)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = c(.7,.8)) + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=2)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('#BF6200','#FF8300',
                             '#9F008C','#416000',
                             '#AEFF00','#000000'),
                    name = 'Ideology',
                    na.translate=TRUE,
                    na.value='#000000') +
  ggtitle("Political Party")
party
```

Here we looked at political party and political ideology. A few of the responses were odd, with a couple very liberal republicans or very conservative democrats. 

## Pew Responses
  
```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width =1536, out.height=800}
library(reshape2)

x <- pewdata[,c('pew1','pew2','pew5a','pew5b','pew5c','pew6','pew7')] %>% sapply(summary)
pew.df <- data.frame(x) %>% as.matrix %>% melt()
ggplot(aes(x = Var2, y = value, fill = Var1, label = value), data = pew.df) +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) + 
  xlab("Pew Question") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette='Paired', name = "Response")

```

Next we made a graph to look at the distribution of answers for the PEW questions. 

## Pew questions vs Ideology

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning= FALSE, out.width =1536, out.height=700,message=FALSE}

pew1ideo = pewdata %>% select(pew1,ideo) %>% na.omit()  
pew1ideotable = data.frame(prop.table(table(pew1ideo),margin=2))
p11= ggplot(pew1ideotable, aes(x=pew1,y=Freq,fill = ideo)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge",stat="identity") +
  geom_text(stat = 'count', position=position_dodge(width = 1),
            aes(y = ..count..,  label = ..count.., vjust = 0)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = c(.9,.7))

pew2ideo = pewdata %>% select(pew2,ideo) %>% na.omit()  
pew2ideotable = data.frame(prop.table(table(pew2ideo),margin=2))
p21 = ggplot(pew2ideotable, aes(x=pew2,y=Freq,fill = ideo)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge",stat="identity") +
  geom_text(stat = 'count', position=position_dodge(width = 1),
            aes(y = ..count..,  label = ..count.., vjust = 0)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = c(.9,.7))

pew6ideo = pewdata %>% select(pew6,ideo) %>% na.omit()  
pew6ideotable = data.frame(prop.table(table(pew6ideo),margin=2))
p61 = ggplot(pew6ideotable, aes(x=pew6,y=Freq,fill = ideo)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge",stat="identity") +
  geom_text(stat = 'count', position=position_dodge(width = 1),
            aes(y = ..count..,  label = ..count.., vjust = 0)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = c(.9,.7))

pew7ideo = pewdata %>% select(pew7,ideo) %>% na.omit()  
pew7ideotable = data.frame(prop.table(table(pew7ideo),margin=2))
p71 = ggplot(pew7ideotable, aes(x=pew7,y=Freq,fill = ideo)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge",stat="identity") +
  geom_text(stat = 'count', position=position_dodge(width = 1),
            aes(y = ..count..,  label = ..count.., vjust = 0)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = c(.9,.7))

pewideo = grid.arrange(p11,p21,p61,p71) 
pewideo
```

Then we looked at how the PEW questions distributed across ideology. We can see that answers for the PEW questions do sometimes differ among ideologies. Specifically people who are very liberal or very conservative have stronger beliefs about PEW1. Now we will try to create a model.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
levels(pewdata$ideo) = c("Extreme","Moderate" , "Moderate", "Moderate","Extreme")
pew2 <- pewdata %>% select(pew1,pew2,pew3,pew4,pew5a,pew5b,pew5c,pew6,pew7,ideo,sex,age,educ2) %>% na.omit

mod1 <- glm(ideo~.-ideo,data=pew2,family="binomial")
summary(mod1)
```

After selecting all of the PEW questions and a couple of extra variables we created a logistic model. The dependent variable here is political ideology. We changed the variable from 5 levels to just 2, extreme and moderate. Extreme included people who were very liberal and very conservative. Moderate was everything else. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
model.pred.prob <- predict(mod1, type='response')
df = data.frame(model.pred.prob)
plot.mpp <- data.frame(prediction = model.pred.prob, 
                       truth = factor(mod1$y, labels=c("Extreme", "Moderate")))

ggplot(plot.mpp, aes(x=truth, y=prediction, fill=truth)) + 
      geom_jitter(width=.2) + geom_violin(alpha=.4) + theme_bw() + geom_hline(yintercept=.79)
```

Then looked at how the model was making predictions. It was very accurate at predicting moderates but less accurate at predicting extremes. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pr <- prediction(model.pred.prob, mod1$y)
perf <- performance(pr, measure="tpr", x.measure="fpr")

perf.f1 <- performance(pr,measure="f")
plot(perf.f1)
```

Next we found a cutoff for the probability that we label the predictions as. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
plot.mpp$pred.class <- ifelse(plot.mpp$prediction <.79, 0,1)

plot.mpp$pred.class <- factor(plot.mpp$pred.class, labels=c("Extreme", "Moderate"))


confusionMatrix(plot.mpp$pred.class, plot.mpp$truth, positive="Extreme")
```

With all of this we had a model with a 82% accuracy. The specificity is very high, but the sensitivity is very low. This could be because of the low sample size of extreme ideologies. Next we made a model with political party being the dependent variable. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
levels(pewdata$party)
levels(pewdata$party) = c("Republican","Democrat" , NA, NA,NA)
pew2 = pewdata %>% select(pew1,pew2,pew3,pew4,pew5a,pew5b,pew5c,pew6,pew7,party,sex,age,educ2) %>% na.omit
mod1 = glm(party~.-party,data=pew2,family="binomial")

mod1pp = predict(mod1,type = "response")
df = data.frame(mod1pp)

plot.mod1pp <- data.frame(prediction = mod1pp, 
                       truth = factor(mod1$y, labels=c("Republican", "Democrat")))

ggplot(plot.mod1pp, aes(x=truth, y=prediction, fill=truth)) + geom_jitter(width=.2) + geom_violin(alpha=.4) + theme_bw()
```

The graph shows that this model has a more even accuracy for both of the categories. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
pr <- prediction(mod1pp, mod1$y)
perf <- performance(pr, measure="tpr", x.measure="fpr")
perf.f1 <- performance(pr,measure="f")
plot(perf.f1)

plot.mod1pp$pred.class <- ifelse(plot.mod1pp$prediction <.49, 0,1)
plot.mod1pp$pred.class <- factor(plot.mod1pp$pred.class, labels=c("Republican", "Democrat"))

confusionMatrix(plot.mod1pp$pred.class, plot.mod1pp$truth, positive="Republican")

```

This model had a higher sensitivity, but it was less accurate overall. 

  
PEW Questions: 
PEW1: How often do you come across news stories about politics that you think are not totally accurate?  
PEW2: And how often do you come across news stories about politics that you think completely made up?  
PEW3: Have you shared a news story you later found out was made up?  
PEW4: Have you shared a news story you thought at the time was made up?  
PEW5a: How much responsibility do members of the public have in trying to prevent made up stories from gaining public attention? 
PEW5b: How much responsibility do government and elected officials have in trying to prevent made up stories from gaining public attention? 
PEW5c: How much responsibility do social media websites have in trying to prevent made up stories from gaining public attention? 
PEW6: How confident are you in your ability to recognize news that is made up?  
PEW7: How much do you think these kind of stories leave Americans confused about the basic facts of current events?
