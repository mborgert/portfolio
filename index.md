####This is my portfolio. All of my school work was just sitting on my computer not benefitting me at all so I figured that I should put it to use. Hopefully this is a good way to show what I know how to do. Without further ado, here it is from newest to oldest:

<table  border="5" bordercolor="black" align="center">

<col width="20%" />
<col width="80%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="header">

<th align="center" >Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><a href=kir_project.html><img src="images/keeping_it_real.jpg" alt="" border=3></img> </td>  
  <td> [Here](kir_project.html) is the project.  </td>

</tr>

</tbody>
</table>
